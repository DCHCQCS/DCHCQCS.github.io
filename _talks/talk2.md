Despite advances, quantum systems remain entrenched within the NISQ era, susceptible to machine-inherent noise and errors originating from external factors.
Sources of errors include environmental decoherence, limited gate fidelities, and hardware imperfections, collectively undermining the accuracy and reliability of quantum computations and thus impeding their practical applicability.
Although we have gained insights into noise sources and their immediate effects within various quantum stacks, there remains a dearth of predictive models capable of assessing the propagation of quantum noise in quantum programs and applications, especially with larger qubit counts. 
Understanding the scaling properties of noise is crucial for characterizing and mitigating complexity at the quantum control level while ensuring dependability.

This workshop session will address the resiliency challenge by focusing on several key areas:

- Compilation and verification of code at the pulse level and above.
- Assessing the complexity, verifiability, and reliability of quantum control and readout.
- Developing models and methodologies for characterizing and designing fault-tolerant architectures.
