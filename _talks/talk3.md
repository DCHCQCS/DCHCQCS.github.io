The integration of classical-quantum systems presents new security challenges, intertwining with existing concerns in classical network security. Preserving the confidentiality of sensitive data, ensuring the integrity of computations, and addressing potential vulnerabilities are paramount for instilling trust and fostering responsible advancement in this evolving domain. At the quantum level, reliance on classical systems for quantum control, coupled with the emergence of unforeseen attack vectors from both existing and novel adversaries, as well as the potential malicious manipulation of quantum program performance, necessitates thorough exploration.

This workshop session delves into several critical facets of achieving security within classical-quantum integration:

- Migration of classical systems to post-quantum cryptography.
- Use of Quantum Cryptography, and particularly Quantum Key Distribution.
- Measuring the adoption rate of quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols and secure quantum secret exchange.
- Ensuring security in both local and distributed quantum computations.
- Safeguarding the quantum hardware supply chain amidst shifting geopolitical landscapes.
- Exploring the potential of quantum network protocols to enhance security in classical and quantum domains.
