Quantum Computing (QC) holds the promise of speeding up High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads by exploiting inherent properties of qubits. Integrating QC in classical HPC systems thus paves the way to a new hybrid computing paradigm: HPC-QC. Such a paradigm unlocks new opportunities and poses fundamentally new challenges. The expectation of the utility of these hybrid systems depends on their dependability, or the ability to operate reliably and securely under a variety of conditions and ensure outcome reproducibility.

This workshop will:
- identify integration challenges between classical and quantum technologies with a focus on end-to-end system dependability,
- anticipate future failures and novel attacks that may affect the availability of HPC-QC systems,
- solidify a diverse community that is inclusive of fields such as QC, cloud computing, HPC, network security, etc.

Our workshop focuses on the need to develop new engineering principles that can define and guarantee the dependability of hybrid classical-quantum systems, and center on the development of metrics with predictive utility to estimate a priori the impact of design decisions: we believe it is possible to move into a more prescriptive classical- quantum co-design cycle rather than rely on purely experimental work. Our overarching goal is to build an open research and development roadmap for dependable hybrid systems engineering that benefits from transferable expertise and skills from other disciplines while identifying core knowledge and technology gaps that need to be filled. This dependable-by-construction approach will prevent design pitfalls and accelerate the maturation of the HPC-QC ecosystem.
